Multithreaded Joke Server and Client </h1> </center>

<font face="Cambria" size="3">

<h2> Overview: </h2>

In this assignment you will build a multi-threaded server that accepts input
from clients, and returns appropriate output. In addition to the basic
client-server model, you will also implement a secondary administration
channel to your server, and manually maintain the state of your distributed
application.<p>

There is some somewhat arbitrary coding involved, but the purpose of each
specification is to give you exposure to writing code for a client-server
environment, and working with threads, neither of which is trivial.</p><p>


Your finished server is just for fun, but with minor changes it can serve
as the basis for a real, viable, client-server application.</p><p>


</p><h2> Administration: </h2>


<ul>

<li> Copy the <a href="http://condor.depaul.edu/elliott/435/hw/programs/checklist-joke.html"> checklist </a> for this
programming assignment. Place it with the files you submit to D2L as
checklist.html. Fill in the blanks. Update it as you make progress.

</li><li> There is a high priority on our being able to download, and run, your
three java applications (JokeServer, JokeClient, JokeClientAdmin) without
any complications. So, even though this may not be the most elegant coding
style, put all your source files in one directory and zip together before
submitting to D2L. Place all files, including the checklist, the logs, and so on, in this directory as well. Make sure that your programs
will compile when we issue "javac *.java" at the command line prompt. Do NOT
use java packages.

</li><li> Submission files for Inet: InetServer.java, InetClient.java [No Inet
files to TurnItIn.com]. Zip these together and submit the one .zip file to
the Inet D2L dropbox.

</li><li> Submission files for JokeServer: JokeServer.java, JokeClient.java,
JokeClientAdmin.java JokeOutput.txt, checklist-joke.html. Zip these together
and submit the one .zip file to the JokeServer D2L dropbox.

</li><li> Concatenate all your JokeServer files, but NO INET FILES, into one
plain ascii text file (.txt) for submission to the second JokeServerTII D2L
dropbox for TurnItIn.com plagiarism checking. 

</li><li> Be sure to include the <a href="http://condor.depaul.edu/elliott/435/RequiredHeaderA.html"> required java
comments header </a> in each of your java files.

</li><li> Make sure that you are familiar with the assignment submission rules.
Programs that do not precisely conform to the rules will not be
graded. Please do not ask for an exception to this policy.

</li><li> Refer to the <a href="http://condor.depaul.edu/elliott/435/hw/programs/inet/InetPDF-D.pdf"> InetServer PDF </a> document, and the
lecture, for large hints on how to get this program working.

</li><li> <a href="http://condor.depaul.edu/~elliott/shared/java/GetJava.html">
Install Java 1.8 </a> if you need to. We will be running your
programs under Java 1.8.

</li><li> You will need several command windows (shells) running separate
processes to run your client/server programs. Command windows are available
under Windows by using [Start | run | cmd].

</li><li> Some sample Java 1.5 Inet <a href="http://condor.depaul.edu/elliott/435/hw/programs/inet/"> .class files </a> and source code are available
to help you get started. (These work fine under Java 1.8). Run the
client/server program
as follows: Download ALL the .class files into a directory (but note that
the InetAddresser program is a standalone version to play with and not
otherwise needed). In one command
window issue: [&gt; java InetServer]. In
<i> another </i> command window issue: [&gt; java InetClient] Then follow the
prompts on the client to look up the IP addresses of machines. Read the code
to see how to shut down the server from the client, etc. Optionally, you can
run the program on two different machines, exactly the same way, but by
starting the client with the name or IP address of the server machine as the
first argument.

</li><li> You may have to speak to your firewall about allowing the client/server
TCP/IP connections, depending on how it is configured.

</li><li> Allow yourself enough time to get a basic version of the JokeServer running. Debugging
TCP/IP on your machine, getting brutalized by your firewall, spawning
runaway processes, etc. comes with the territory, and you should not
underestimate the amount of time this will take you during the initial
phases of this project.

</li><li> You will have to figure out a way to capture the output from your
running programs so that they can be placed in an ascii text file, and this
might take some time.

</li><li> Note that you have to maintain a theoretically unlimited number of
arrays to keep track of client state, and this may take some thought.

</li><li> Allow yourself enough time to format the presentation of your work <i>
exactly </i> as specified. This may take some thought and some time the
first time you do this. That is, you may have to install and learn an
editor for creating ascii files, etc. You should NOT assume that you can get
this done at the last minute.

</li></ul>

<h2> Basic Multi-threaded server: </h2>

<ul>

<li> TYPE IN THE INET CLIENT AND SERVER JAVA PROGRAMS if you are not well
familiar with multi-threaded client/server applications. Get them running. I
know that you can manage a cut and paste version, but for many this will
have prove to have been a mistake when later trying to get the JokeServer program written. In my
experience, the 30-40 minutes to type in the programs yourself, fix the bugs
you have introduced, and figure out how they run, will be paid back many
times over.

</li><li> Change the port of the server to something of your own choosing, above
port 4,000.

</li><li> Add YOUR clear, informative, COMMENTS to the Inet code, explaining what
it does. Comments are an important part of your grade. Discuss at the
forums. Have some fun making minor modifications. Submit to D2L for
credit.

</li><li> Do NOT submit this Inet code to TurnItIn.com.

</li><li> You will need to run the client, and server, in different command
windows.

</li><li> Once you get your distributed application running on a single machine,
try running the client and server on different machines, if you have them
available. (Note that you will have to pass the IP address of the server as
an argument to the client.) [To find the IP address of your machine under
Windows, type "ipconfig" at a command prompt; use "ifconfig" under unix.]

</li></ul>
<h2> Modifications: </h2>

<h3> Basic Overview: </h3>

<ul>

<li> Your JokeClient sends (some version of) the message "Give me something"
to the JokeServer. [Note: the user just presses enter.]
</li><li> Your JokeServer sends back a joke or a proverb, depending on what mode
it is in.
</li><li> For each conversation with a client, complete sets of five jokes, and independently five
proverbs, are returned to the client one at a time, before any joke or proverb is repeated.
</li><li> Your JokeClientAdmin connects to the server and sets it in Joke mode
[the default], Proverb mode, or Maintenance mode.

</li></ul>


<h3> Modify client and server as follows:</h3>
<ol>

<li> Modify the server so that instead of looking up DNS translations it
returns (strictly clean!) jokes and proverbs.

</li><li> Build a corpus of at exactly five joke/proverb templates which the server can
send back, randomly, to the client. (The randomizing is a small part of the
assignment, but think about this problem: How might you implement randomness
efficiently? Why might a linked data structure be useful here? Does your
solution scale up?)

</li><li> Modify the server so that it accepts a name as input from the client
(one time!), and thereafter inserts the name appropriately into the body of
the joke or proverb. The user need only press <enter> repreatedly to make
repeated requests of the server.

That is,  you start with the text:<p>

<i> A. Why did Xname cross the road? To get to the other side!</i> </p><p>

And you get back: </p><p>
<i> A. Why did Joseph cross the road? To get to the other
side! </i></p><p>

</p></enter></li><li>  For ease of debugging, and also grading, label your jokes (and also
proverbs, below) with the letters A - E.


<p>

</p></li></ol>


<h3> Further modify the server as follows:</h3>

<ol> 

<li> Modify the server to accept a connection, at a different port, from an
administration client. This will take some thought because you will have to
make an asynchronous call, using a separate thread, to start a second server
listener waiting for administration client connections. See the file <a href="http://condor.depaul.edu/elliott/435/hw/programs/joke/joke-threads.html"> joke-threads.html </a> for some hints, and
the file <a href="http://condor.depaul.edu/elliott/435/hw/programs/joke/joke-pseudo.html"> joke-pseudo.html </a> for some
rough pseudo code.


</li><li> Write a second client that connects at the administration port and
sends commands to set the server in (a) joke mode (b) proverb mode, and
(c) maintenance mode. 

</li><li> The JokeServer MUST run, by default, in joke mode, without needing to
start up the admin client.

</li><li> Build a corpus of exactly five proverb templates, and an additional
text message that states "The server is temporarily unavailable -- check-back
shortly." 

</li><li> The administration commands are: "joke-mode", "proverb-mode" and
"maintenance-mode" 

</li><li> You will have already written joke-mode. In proverb-mode the server
inserts the name sent into a proverb, which it then returns to the
client.<p>

That is, in proverb-mode, you start with the text:</p><p>

<i> D. It is important to remember that if Xname is early to bed and early to
rise, then Xname will be healthy, wealthy, and wise. </i> </p><p>

And you get back: </p><p>

<i> D. It is important to remember that if Joseph is early to
bed and early to rise, then Joseph will be healthy, wealthy, and wise. </i>
</p><p>

</p></li><li> In maintenance-mode, simply always send back the warning message.


</li></ol>


<h3> State Maintenance: </h3>

<ul>

<li> How you maintain the state of client conversations is up to you, as
long as always break the connection after each joke, or proverb, is returned.

<p></p></li><li> You have many ways that you can implement state maintenance. For
example:<p>

</p><ol>

<li> MINIMAL COOKIE ON THE CLIENT; FULL STATE ON THE SERVER: You can maintain state by sending a unique "cookie" (e.g., a UUID would
be one way to implement this) from the client when it first connects, and
then passing the cookie back to the client from the server. Pass
the "cookie" from the client each time it connects, and use it on the
server to look up the state of the conversation which has been stored there. Use this mechanism to
guarantee that the client never gets a joke, or proverb, repeated until ALL
of the jokes/proverbs have been sent. Then, cycle through all the jokes/proverbs again. Send
the jokes, and also proverbs, in random order, but constrained as specified. See the file <a href="http://condor.depaul.edu/elliott/435/hw/programs/joke/joke-state.html"> joke-state.html
</a> for some pointers on maintaining the state of the client. <p>



</p></li><li> FULL STATE ON THE CLIENT; NOTHING ON THE SERVER: You can send the entire state back to the client after updating by the server, and maintain nothing at the
server side. That is, read and update the checklist at the server, and then
send the whole checklist back to the client. Each time the client connects,
it sends the entire state again.  <p>

</p></li><li> NOTHING ON THE CLIENT: It is not possible to implement the JokeServer
this way. Why? <p>

</p></li><li> MAINTAIN STATE ON BOTH ENDS: You can implement anything in between the above two schemes, such as
keeping the cookie and the joke-state on the client, and the proverb-state
on the server. <p>

</p></li><li> MUST CONNECT TO SERVER: You can download your five jokes and five proverbs when you first
connect, then just ask the server what mode state it is in each time you
re-connect. When the jokes or proverbs are exhausted, you can reconnect to
get them randomized and downloaded again, or just randomize them on the
client, depending on your design and how often you envision the jokes and
proverbs being updated. <p>

</p></li><li> Cookie variation: Optionally you could initially send an empty
cookie/state structure from the client at startup time, and have the server
assign a value when it notices that the cookie or state structure has not
been initialized. This allows the use of a simple counter maintained by the
server.<p>

</p></li></ol>

</li><li> Maintain state for each client such that if the server is, e.g.,
switched from joke-mode to proverb-mode, and then back again to joke-mode,
the constraint that no joke is repeated until all five have been randomly
returned is maintained across these transitions among server
states. (Similarly, this constraint also holds for proverbs.)<p>

</p></li><li> You can assume that when your client process is stopped, its entire
state is permanently discarded (but see bragging rights below).
You can assume that when your server process is stopped, its current mode 
state is permanently discarded. You can make a choice about whether client
conversations are discarded as well, depending on how you've implemented
state maintenance.<p>

</p></li><li> We should be able to start your clients, and your server, in any order,
when running your system.<p>

</p></li><li> Implement your client such that after we enter a user name, the client
just allows us to keep pressing the enter key for more responses. Implement
your admin client such that we either cycle through the three modes with
repeated presses of the enter key, or we just have to enter something simple
like "j" "p" and "m" for each of the modes. Be sure to display this
information at startup.<p>



</p></li><li> Questions: for a large-scale production system, when is it appropriate to send just
a cookie back to the client? When should the whole state be sent to the
client? Suppose that in place of jokes you were sending 4 GByte database
entries? Suppose that instead of a static joke, you were computing, in real
time, some highly cpu-intensive output based on input data assessed at the
server at the time of the request? Which design would you use for each? How
would your solution scale?

</li></ul>


<h3> Bragging Rights: </h3>
<ul>

<li> These modifications are not required, but if you complete them, let me
know about it!

</li><li> It is not required that your admin client have the capability to shut
down your server, but it would be nice. You can implement this in a simple
non-elegant way by accepting a "shutdown" string from your admin
client, and then when seeing this at the server, change both of the loop
variables to false, then sending two more connections, one to each server
(joke / admin) to trigger breaking from each loop. More elegantly you can
look at the "HostServer" code to see how to "reach back" from the worker
thread and kill off the parent loop.

</li><li> Make your client and server somewhat fault-tolerant by writing the
state to disk after each request at both the client side and the server
side, so that if either crashes, on restart they read the state back in from
disk before resuming operation. You will need to identify your user to the
client in this case.

</li><li> Hard: Modify your client and server so that they use a secure channel for
administration via SSL.

</li><li> Hard: See the associated project for creating an asynchronous
JokeServer Client, possibly that also connects to multiple JokeServers.

</li></ul>


<h3> Execution: </h3>
<ul>
<li> Run your sever with multiple clients active at the same time. Interleave
requests from different clients. Capture ten output responses from one
client in joke mode, ten in proverb mode, showing that the jokes and
proverbs are returned randomly, but not repeated until all five have been
sent back.

</li><li> Repeat the process, but this time use your adminstration client to
interleave joke-mode and proverb-mode, showing that state is correctly
maintained across changes between modes.

</li><li> Put the output from your running sessions in a text file (as specified)
and ANNOTATE the output--highlighting the randomness of the jokes, the
interleaving of modes, etc. Do NOT change any of the output data, but you
can add some white space to make it easier to read if you like.

</li><li> Format the presentation and submission of your work <i> exactly </i> as specified.

</li></ul>
